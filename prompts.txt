You are an expert React developer tasked with building a highly performant, client-side-only Emoji Translator application using functional components and hooks.

Here are the detailed requirements for the App.jsx component:

UI and State Management:

Create a clean user interface with a title, a <textarea> for user input, a "Translate" button, and an area to display the output.

Use React useState hooks to manage the application's state, including: inputText, translatedText, isLoading, and emojiMap.

Performant Data Handling (CRITICAL):

The application will use a large data file located at /data/emoji.json (this file is in the public/data/ directory).

This file must NOT be imported directly. It must be fetched from the network using fetch() inside a useEffect hook that runs only once when the component mounts.

While the data is being fetched and processed, the isLoading state should be true. The UI must display a clear loading indicator (e.g., a message like "Loading emoji dictionary...") and the "Translate" button should be disabled.

Efficient Emoji Lookup Map:

After the emoji.json data is successfully fetched, you must process it once to create an efficient lookup map (a JavaScript Object or Map).

The emoji.json file is an array of objects, each with "aliases" and "tags" (arrays of strings) and an "emoji" character.

Iterate through this array and create a single map where every string from aliases and tags becomes a key, and the corresponding emoji character is the value.

Store this generated map in the emojiMap state. Once the map is created, set isLoading to false.

Translation Logic:

The translation function should be triggered when the "Translate" button is clicked.

It should take the inputText, split it into words, and for each word:

Sanitize the word by converting it to lowercase and removing basic punctuation for lookup purposes.

Use the generated emojiMap to find a corresponding emoji for the sanitized word.

If a match is found, use the emoji.

If no match is found, use the original word to preserve its original case and punctuation.

Join the results back into a string and display it in the translatedText state.

Final Polish:

The application must be fully self-contained in a single React component file.

Use modern styling with Tailwind CSS to make the UI look clean and professional.


2 - You are an expert React developer. Your task is to upgrade an existing client-side Emoji Translator App.jsx component with two new key features: a "Clear" button for user convenience, and a more advanced translation logic that supports multi-word emoji phrases.

Here are the detailed requirements:

Feature 1: Add a "Clear" Button:

In the UI, add a new button next to the existing "Translate" button.

This button should be styled differently to distinguish it (e.g., a gray or red outline).

When clicked, this button must reset both the inputText and translatedText states to empty strings, effectively clearing the text area and the output for the user to start over.

Feature 2: Implement Multi-Word Emoji Mapping (CRITICAL LOGIC UPGRADE):

The current translation logic only handles single words. This needs to be upgraded to recognize and translate common multi-word phrases (e.g., "ice cream" -> "🍦").

Data Pre-processing: The useEffect hook that fetches and processes /data/emoji.json must now be smarter. It needs to create two separate lookup maps:

A multiWordMap for phrases that contain spaces (e.g., { "ice cream": "🍦", "video game": "🎮" }).

A singleWordMap for all other single-word keywords.

The logic should iterate through the aliases and tags from emoji.json and populate the appropriate map based on whether the keyword contains a space character.

New Translation Algorithm: The core translation function must be completely rewritten to use a more advanced parsing strategy that prioritizes longer matches. Do NOT use a simple split(' ') approach. Instead, implement a greedy algorithm that iterates through the input string:

Create a results array.

Use a while loop to process the input string from left to right using an index.

At the current index, first check if any phrases from the multiWordMap are a match. You may need to check for the longest possible phrase match starting at that position.

If a multi-word match is found, push its corresponding emoji to the results array and advance the index past the matched phrase.

If no multi-word match is found, process the text as a single word. Push the translated word (or the original word if no single-word match is found) to the results, and advance the index.

Join the results array at the end to form the final translatedText. This ensures spacing and order are preserved correctly.

Maintain Existing Functionality:

All existing functionality (the core UI layout, fetching data on mount, the loading state, and single-word translations) must be preserved and work seamlessly with the new features.



Summary of Your Prompts for Amazon Q
1. Initial App Creation:
You started with a straightforward request to build the core application.

"Build a React App for an Emoji Translator that converts plain text to emoji-enhanced text, keeping words without mappings and preserving sentence structure."

2. Handling a Large Emoji List (Client-Side):
You upgraded from a small, hardcoded list to a more robust solution by fetching a large data file.

"Upgrade the React app to fetch a large emoji.json file from the /public folder on startup. Show a loading state, process the file into an efficient lookup map, and then enable translation."

3. Adding "Clear" Button & Multi-Word Logic:
You added a quality-of-life feature and made the translation logic smarter.

"Add a 'Clear' button to the UI. Upgrade the translation logic to support multi-word phrases like 'ice cream' by creating two separate lookup maps (for single and multi-word) and using a more advanced parsing algorithm."

4. Intelligent Plural Handling:
You made the translator more intelligent by handling common plurals.

"Upgrade the single-word lookup logic. If a word like 'elephants' isn't found, check if it ends in 's', create a singular guess like 'elephant', and try looking that up."

5. The "Bulletproof" Logic Fix:
After the AI struggled to combine features, you gave a highly detailed prompt to create a unified, bug-free translation algorithm.

"Fix a bug where multi-word and single-word logic conflict. Implement a unified 'greedy' translation algorithm using a while loop that always prioritizes the longest possible multi-word match before falling back to single-word and plural checks."

6. Reverse Translation Feature:
You added a major new feature to translate in the opposite direction.

"Add a reverse translation feature. Include a 'Swap' button to toggle the mode, create a new emojiToKeywordsMap for reverse lookups, and implement the emoji-to-text logic."

7. "Enchanted Forest" UI Redesign:
You gave the app a complete visual overhaul with a beautiful, animated theme.

"Redesign the entire UI into an 'Enchanted Forest' theme using pure CSS. Create a dark green/blue gradient background and add animated animal emojis that drift across the screen. Style the main UI card with a 'glassmorphism' (frosted glass) effect."

8. "Copy to Clipboard" Feature:
Finally, you added a crucial piece of professional polish to make the app truly useful.

"Add a 'Copy to Clipboard' button inside the output area. The button should show a clipboard icon by default and switch to a checkmark icon for 2 seconds after a successful copy to provide clear user feedback."
